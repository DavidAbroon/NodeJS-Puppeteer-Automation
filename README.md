# NodeJS-Puppeteer-Automation
NodeJS script using Puppeteer to automate timesheet completion.

This script was created for the Ascender Pay web-self-service app.
It prompts the user to enter their Credentials, Start Time, End Time, Break Time and Comments.
It then utilitses the Puppeteer API to log in, navigate to the FlexSheet page and fill in the time sheet.
It runs in the user's installed Chrome application, so the user can double check the timesheet, make any changes and click Submit.
